"""
Generates .streamlit/secrets.toml from environment variables at startup.

Streamlit's native authentication (st.login / st.user) reads its config from
the [auth] section of .streamlit/secrets.toml -- it does NOT read environment
variables. 

Railway (deployment platform) only reads from env vars so this script materializes the file before the
app launches. It is invoked from the Railway start command.

Note: local development uses a real .streamlit/secrets.toml and never runs this.
